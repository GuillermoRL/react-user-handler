A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see inside

    ├── node_modules
    ├── public
    ├── src
    ├── .babelrc
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    ├── README.md
    └── .webpack.config.js

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/public`**: This directory will contain public resources like icons, images, fonts than provide the design view.

3.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

4.  **`.babelrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Babel]. Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.

5.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

6.  **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

7.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

8.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

9.  **webpack.config.js**: can be used to quickly develop an application. See the development guide to get started

NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS UNCOMPLITED!
